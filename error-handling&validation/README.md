# Validation and Error Handling in Web Applications

## 1. What is Validation?

Validation is the process of checking if user input is correct, complete, and acceptable before it is processed by the system.

### Examples:
- Email must contain "@"
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- Age must be a number

### Why Validation is Important:
- Prevents incorrect or invalid data
- Improves user experience
- Reduces system errors

### Validation Criteria:
- Input matches expected format
- Required fields are not empty

## 2. Types of Validation

### Client-Side Validation
- Performed in the browser
- Provides instant feedback to users
- Improves user experience

### Server-Side Validation
- Performed on the backend
- Ensures data security and integrity
- Final authority for validation

### Key Concept:
Client-side validation improves usability, while server-side validation ensures trust and security.

## 3. What is an Error?

An error occurs when an application fails to complete an operation as expected.

### Common Causes:
- Invalid user input
- Missing required data
- Unauthorized access
- Server or database failure


---

## 4. Types of Errors

### Validation Errors
- Caused by incorrect or missing user input
- Example: Empty form field

### Authentication Errors
- User is not logged in or credentials are incorrect

### Authorization Errors
- User lacks permission to access a resource
- Example: Normal user accessing admin page

### System / Server Errors
- Internal issues such as database failure or server crash


---

## 5. Error Communication

Good error messages should be:

- Clear
- User-friendly
- Actionable

### Example:

Bad:
Error occurred

Good:
Password must be at least 8 characters long


---

## 6. HTTP Status Codes (Conceptual)

### 2xx – Success
- Request processed successfully

### 4xx – Client Errors
- Invalid input
- Unauthorized or forbidden access

### 5xx – Server Errors
- Internal server issues
- Service unavailable

### Key Concept:
Status codes help identify the type of problem without exposing system details.


---

## 7. Best Practices

- Always validate user input
- Do not rely only on client-side validation
- Handle errors gracefully
- Do not expose sensitive system details
- Log errors internally for debugging


---

## Conclusion

Validation and error handling are essential for building reliable and secure applications. They ensure that user input is correct, prevent system failures, and provide meaningful feedback to users.
